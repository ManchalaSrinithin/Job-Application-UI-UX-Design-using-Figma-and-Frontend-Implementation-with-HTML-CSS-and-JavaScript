## Overview

The aim of this project is to create a web application for job seekers, interns, and professional job seekers to streamline their job search and career management.

- **Notifications and Messages**: Through their profile, users receive notifications for job updates, interview calls, and relevant communications.

- **Profile Comparison**: The platform allows users to compare their profiles with others, providing insights into when they might get hired based on qualifications and industry trends.

- **Career Guidance**: Freshers or those transitioning to new careers can access career-building strategies, book recommendations, and other advice to help them progress in their chosen fields.

- **Easy Job Search**: Users can search for jobs from various companies with ease, simplifying the job hunt.
